# Arduino Project 6 – Controlling an LED with an Ultrasonic Sensor 📏💡

This project uses an **ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)** to detect distance and control an LED.  
When an object comes closer than a set threshold, the LED turns **ON**; otherwise, it stays **OFF**.  

## 🛠️ What I Learnt
- How ultrasonic sensors work (time-of-flight principle)  
- Using `pulseIn()` to measure distance  
- Conditional control of outputs based on sensor readings

## 🔌 Components Used
- 1 x Arduino board 
- 1 x HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
- 1 x LED  
- 1 x 220Ω resistor  
- Breadboard + jumper wires
